    <font color="333333"><p>Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20th, 1988 in Saint Michael, Barbados. Her father was Afro-barbadian and Irish and her mother, Afro-Guyanese. Her father was addicted to alcohol and drugs. Rihanna had very excruciating headaches when she was very young, which they had stopped after her mother and father divorced. Rihanna was an army cadet in a pre-military program. Rihanna grew up lisetening to reggae music and began singing at age 14. She wanted to persue singing and left the army program. In Bridgetown, where Rihanna grew up, is where she also recorded her first album, <i>"Music of the Sun"</i> in 2003. And following after that album, <i>"A Girl Like Me"</i> was recorded and had hit top charts in 2006.</p></font>

    <p>Rihanna has claimed her chance of fame but she also wants to give back. In 2006, she created her  Believe Foundation to help terminally ill children. Rihanna had held many performance concerts to help raise funds for charities and foundations. Rihanna has also had an autograph signing, and posed for pictures with children from local charities. All together, Rihanna had supported, 27 causes and 24 charities/foundations. She has even won a humanitarian award this year, in 2017!
